This will eventually be a software framework for open direct democracy.

Install
	This is not really usable, but it's getting there.

Todo
- always take most recent vote

- how do we decide if a citizen is allowed to vote in this governing body?(if for nothing else than to limit to 1 unit of voting power per person). solve this

- better networking
	- p2p
	- get past NAT
- proxy voting	
- tagging laws by issue/interest

- ui overhaul (horrible is too generous of a word)

Done
- ask for new law data when we receive votes for unknown laws
- identify laws in some unique manner(using uuid - random)
- request citizen pubkey/info when we receive votes by unknown citizens 
- needed command line flags
- default user & other config
- identify citizens by fingerprint/some other unique id instead of name
- clean up gpg stuff, 
	add config to set gpg binary/key storage path
	select which key to use and prompt for passcode to sign votes
